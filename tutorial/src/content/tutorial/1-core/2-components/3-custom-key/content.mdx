# Custom key

As we could see, we can use a function itself to retreive values from the container. But sometimes we'd like to use a custom key to inject a value.

For example during testing it is useful to provide a mock with the key of the original service.

We can do so by using the `provide` method.

First let's create the mock:

```typescript
const mockMessageProvider = {
    getMessage: (moduleName: string, message: string) => {
        console.log("Mocked message provider called with", moduleName, message);
    },
};
```

Then we can provide this mock with the key of the original service.

Notice that provider still accepts a builder as second paramenter. We need to return this value from an arrow function.

```diff
createContainer(
+   provide(MessageProvider, () => mockMessageProvider),
-   MessageProvider
```

As you can see, we didn't need to change the runner, that could still get the MessageProvider, only it was different implementation.
